# Day 3: [Date]

**Today's Challenge:**
We have learned enough skills for a simple, but cool, project!

Remember when you were a kid and thought the ideal dinner would just be all your favorite things mixed in a bowl? How did that Nutella Mac & Cheese taste? Well - let's come up with a recipe generator to build us an amazing dish for today's evening meal!

You will need to:

1.  Create these as a variable:
    -   A type of food
    -   A type of plant
    -   A method of cooking
    -   A word to describe burned food
    -   A household item

2. Output a nice looking Recipe page that *concatenates* a dish in this format:
cooking food with burned plant on a bed of item
