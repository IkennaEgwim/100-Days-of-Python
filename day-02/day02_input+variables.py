# ### **Today's Challenge:**
# - Write code that does the following:

# 1.  Asks for the user's name, favorite food, favorite music and where they live (or you can create other questions!)
# 2.  Store all of the answers in different variables.
# 3.  Print out a full sentence that includes the user's favorite things.
# 4.  Give them a positive affirmation at the end - tell them they rock at doing something!

# Example solution: 

# You are
# Mark
# You're probably hungry for
# Burritos
# and you're definitely getting your groove on to
# Synthwave and Anything by our man Rick Astley
# living in the amazing
# Edge of reality

print("I am gonna ask you a few questions, hope you don't mind?")
username = input("What is your name: ")
favoriteFood = input("What's your favorite food: ")
favoriteMusic = input("what's your favorite music: ")
location = input("Where do you live: ")
print()
print("Getting to know you!")
print("You are")
print(username)
print("You're probably hungry for")
print(favoriteFood)
print("and you're definitely getting your groove on to")
print(favoriteMusic)
